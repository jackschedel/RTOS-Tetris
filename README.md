## 
Developed a fully custom RTOS from the ground up, to be used with Tiva C Series processors. Programmed a fully featured Tetris game from scratch using the RTOS. By heavily optimizing the thread context switching and minimizing unnecessary redraws (on a very slow display), the resulting gameplay is snappy and lag-free, despite only running on a 16MHz processor.
